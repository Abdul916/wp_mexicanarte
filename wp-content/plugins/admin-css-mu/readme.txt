Add custom CSS to style the WordPress Admin. Works with Multisites. 

== Description ==

A simple plugin that lets you add your custom CSS to style the WordPress Admin. Works with WordPress single install and WordPress multisites. 

Version 2.0 is updated wtih an Admin interface and can be found in Appearance > Admin CSS MU

Admin CSS MU uses CSSTidy to clean and optionally minify CSS. CSS is only minified while using it. The editor always shows un-minified CSS for easy editing. 

Note: If you want to easily add custom CSS on your Login and Front-end as well (along with WordPress Admin), use my [Custom Login Admin Front-end CSS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-login-admin-front-end-css-with-multisite-support/) plugin instead. 

== Installation ==

To use as a normal plugin in WordPress single install and Multisite.

1. Install the plugin through the WordPress admin interface, or upload the folder /admin-css-mu/ to /wp-content/plugins/ using ftp.
2. Activate the plugin via WordPress admin interface. If it is a Multisite, Network Activate it.
3. Go to WordPress Admin > Appearance > Admin CSS MU and add the custom CSS you want. 
4. For Multisites, the settings page will be in the Appearance > Admin CSS MU of the main site. Only network admins can add/edit CSS.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I try the CSS sample from the screenshot? =

Sure! To change the background colour of the dashboard add this and save.

`#wpwrap {
	background-color: #5f5f5f !important;
}
body, h1, p {
	color: #f1f1f1 !important;
}`
